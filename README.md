# [Carbon Platform](http://carbonldp.com/)

## Introduction

Carbon provides the building blocks, tools, and services that developers need to build with freedom and creativity. It exposes a JSON/REST API through which apps can manage information - listing, creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources of any type. The resources used by a Carbon app can conform to any schema, which does not have to be pre-created and which can change without the need for schema changes in the datastore. The platform provides application development features in a GUI that allow developers to work visually and easily before any of the visual elements of their own app are produced. For those parts of an app that are non-visual, or for developing web services, the platform provides a JavaScript API and a variety of server-side modules. The JavaScript API is designed to abstract and simplify use of the JSON/REST API - allowing developers to focus primarily on the GUI and logic that is unique to their application. Server-side modules execute logic on the server and perform functions that are commonly required (e.g. uploading, e-mailing, caching). In addition to providing a host of useful modules as building blocks, developers can extend their apps and the platform itself by registering custom modules. Custom modules leverage a server-side scripting language that eliminates the need for developers to wrestle with deploying compiled packages.
