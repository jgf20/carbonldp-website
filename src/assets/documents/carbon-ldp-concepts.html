<h2>The Carbon Document object</h2>

<p>With Carbon, you work with data in documents. Simple enough, right? They're very much like web pages. You can
    retrieve them from the server, modify them, and then put them back. You can do this in Carbon using RESTful
    requests over HTTP and methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, but even that is a lower-level API. You'll
    probably prefer the JavaScript SDK, which lets you work with documents as JavaScript objects. The JavaScript
    SDK handles the HTTP requests responsible for getting and persisting data, so all you have to do is call
    simple functions on your <code>Document</code> objects.
</p>

<p>Under the hood, an instance of a document represents an RDF graph, which is basically a set of RDF statements called
    triples.</p>

<p>INSERT GRAPHIC OF DOCUMENT WITH A GRAPH ON IT (something iconographic that we can continue to use to represent
    documents)</p>

<p>Every document is identified by a URI, which is globally unique. That is to say, the URI is unique, not only within
    your application, but also on the World Wide Web. The URI is of a document can also be thought of as a unique
    identifier for the resources that it represents, which is typically some real-world thing like a person,
    organization, or product. Following, for example, is a URI that identifies a person:</p>

<p><code>http://example.carbonldp.com/apps/ourco/people/john-doe/</code></p>

<p>We could use such a URI in a request to get the document from the Carbon server. When using Carbon's lower-level REST
    API, you can use the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header to tell the server to give you the document in a variety of
    representations such as Turtle, JSON-LD, or RDF XML. If you make the request through Carbon's JavaScript SDK,
    however, the resource will always be returned as a Document object, automatically parsed and ready to use in your
    JavaScript code. The inverse is also true. You can create a Carbon Document entirely in JavaScript code and then
    POST or PUT it to the server. Carbon will automatically serialize and save the document as an RDF graph.</p>

<p>So, in short, you can use the JavaScript SDK to create a document, populate it with data attributes, and then
    persist the document to the database. Once saved, you can later retrieve the document to read or modify its
    attributes.</p>
