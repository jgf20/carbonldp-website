<p>Carbon provides services for working with data through a JavaScript SDK and REST API. Data is stored in a graph
    database, which is more advantageous than traditional relational databases in a wide variety of cases. Since the
    data is stored natively in RDF (the Resource Description Framework), Carbon makes it easy to model any kind of
    resources without the need for rigid schemas. Need a new class, instance, property, or relationship? Simply add
    it on-the-fly. Forget about primary and foreign key relationships. In Carbon, everything is semantic - capable of
    linking data within your organization and on the World Wide Web.</p>

<p>Carbon LDP turns data graphs into documents so that working with data is like working with web pages - simple. Each
    document also acts as a container for managing members and as an access point that can be queried with SPARQL.
    Carbon makes managing data more like managing content - easy.</p>

<p>Carbon LDP is hosted on IBM Bluemix, which delivers the advantages of cloud computing such as reduced
    support and hardware needs, better scalability, elasticity, and managed hosting. Additionally, IBM Bluemix makes
    a broad range of services available to Carbon apps that you may host there - Watson, Data &amp; Analytics,
    Mobile &amp; Internet of Things, to name a few. If youâ€™re concerned about hosting corporate data on the public
    cloud, a Carbon instance can be spun-up easily in a private cloud, hybrid cloud, or on any Linux based server
    using Docker container-based virtualization technology.</p>
