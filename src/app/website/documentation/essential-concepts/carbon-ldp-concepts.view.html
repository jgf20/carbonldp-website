						<p>Carbon LDP is a cloud-based Linked Data Platform for building, hosting,
							managing, and running web applications of all types. In addition to standard LDP
							capabilities, Carbon delivers one-of-a-kind features that can transform the way you work.
							This document provides an introduction to some of the features and concepts that make Carbon
							LDP uniquely valuable for building web solutions.</p>

				<h2>The Carbon Document object</h2>

				<p>With Carbon, you work with data in documents. Simple enough, right? They're very much like web pages.
					You can
					retrieve them from the server, modify them, and then put them back. You can do this in Carbon using
					RESTful
					requests over HTTP and methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, but even that is a lower-level API.
					You'll
					probably prefer the JavaScript SDK, which lets you work with documents as JavaScript objects. The
					JavaScript
					SDK handles the HTTP requests responsible for getting and persisting data, so all you have to do is
					call
					simple functions on your <code>Document</code> objects.
				</p>

				<p>Under the hood, an instance of a document represents an RDF graph, which is basically a set of RDF
					statements called
					triples.</p>

				<p>INSERT GRAPHIC OF DOCUMENT WITH A GRAPH ON IT (something iconographic that we can continue to use to
					represent
					documents)</p>

				<p>Every document is identified by a URI, which is globally unique. That is to say, the URI is unique,
					not only within
					your application, but also on the World Wide Web. The URI is of a document can also be thought of as
					a unique
					identifier for the resources that it represents, which is typically some real-world thing like a
					person,
					organization, or product. Following, for example, is a URI that identifies a person:</p>

				<p>
				<center><code>http://example.carbonldp.com/apps/ourco/people/john-doe/</code></center>
				</p>

				<p>We could use such a URI in a request to get the document from the Carbon server. When using Carbon's
					lower-level REST
					API, you can use the HTTP <code>Accept</code> header to tell the server to give you the document in
					a variety of
					representations such as Turtle, JSON-LD, or RDF XML. If you make the request through Carbon's
					JavaScript SDK,
					however, the resource will always be returned as a Document object, automatically parsed and ready
					to use in your
					JavaScript code. The inverse is also true. You can create a Carbon Document entirely in JavaScript
					code and then
					POST or PUT it to the server. Carbon will automatically serialize and save the document as an RDF
					graph.</p>

				<p>So, in short, you can use the JavaScript SDK to create a document, populate it with data attributes,
					and then
					persist the document to the database. Once saved, you can later retrieve the document to read or
					modify its
					attributes.</p>
