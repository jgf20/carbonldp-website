						<h2 class="ui header">Document</h2>

						<p>In simplest terms a Document is the basic unit of information in Carbon. Any Carbon platform
							will be composed of a group of applications that will consist of a group of Documents.</p>

						<p>A Carbon Document is composed of:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Properties</li>
							<li>Fragments</li>
							<li>NamedFragments</li>
						</ul>

						<p>A Carbon Document is javascript object identified by an URI. This object can have any number of properties and nested objects.
							All the properties in a javascript object correspond to the properties of a Carbon Document, the nested objects correspond to
							the fragments or named fragments, depending on whether or not the nested objects have an id defined or not.</p>

						</div>

						<!--<p>Why call it Document?
						It's an analogy. Between webpage content and our data structure. We all know what a Document on a web page is. In webpage content a Document has a URL, sections and links. It
						has a main section with information relevant to the Document, and it may have secondary sections that may be relevant to the main section (named fragment) or may not be
						revelant (fragments). And finally documents have links to other Documents.</p>-->


						<h3 class="ui header">Fragments</h3>
						<p> A fragment is a javascript object nested inside a Document. Fragments have a local id can not be reference from outside the Document. Fragments have ids
							that are automatically assigned by the Carbon SDK, these ids start with an underscore, for example:
							<code>_:123</code></p>

						<p> A Fragment can only be referenced from within the Document to which it belongs.</p>

						<h3 class="ui header">Named Fragments</h3>
						<p> A Named Fragment is, like a Fragment, a javascript object nested inside a Document.
							However, Named Fragments have ids that are re, allowing it to be referenced from
							the outside of the Document in which it exists. These ids start with a #, for example: <code>#namedFragment</code></p>
						<p>The ids of a Named Fragment complement the URI of the Document to which they belong :
							<code>https://carbonldp.com/apps/test-app/myDocument#namedFragment.</code>
						</p>

						<h2 class="ui header">Applications</h2>

						A Carbon application
						<section>
							<h3 class="ui header">Root Document</h3>
							<p>When you create an application in Carbon, automatically a root Document is created.
								The root Document contains all the relevant information about your application and is the root parent for all the information and Documents created in it.
								...Whar is inside a Root Document...

								Carbon Document structure can be viewed as a tree, in the sense that every Document you create is the child of a previous existing Document, beginning with the root
								Document. You can't create a Document that doesn't have a parent Document.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3 class="ui header">Linked Documents</h3>
							<section>
								As we said before all the Carbon Documents must have a parent, this means that when a document is created there is also link formed between the parent Document
								and the new created child. This is a natural link that exists in Carbon, however there are a other types of linkes that can exist.
