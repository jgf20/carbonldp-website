						<h2 class="ui header">Document</h2>

						<p>In simplest terms a Document is the basic unit of information in Carbon. Any Carbon platform
							will be composed of a group of applications that in turn will consist of a group of Documents.</p>

						<p>A Carbon Document is composed of:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Properties</li>
							<li>Fragments</li>
							<li>NamedFragments</li>
						</ul>

						<p>A Carbon Document is a javascript object identified by an URI, that can have any number of properties and nested objects.
							All the properties in a javascript object are maintained as properties of a Carbon Document, while the nested objects correspond to
							the fragments or named fragments, depending on whether or not the nested objects have an id defined or not.</p>

						<!--<p>Why call it Document?
						It's an analogy. Between webpage content and our data structure. We all know what a Document on a web page is. In webpage content a Document has a URL, sections and links. It
						has a main section with information relevant to the Document, and it may have secondary sections that may be relevant to the main section (named fragment) or may not be
						revelant (fragments). And finally documents have links to other Documents.</p>-->


						<h3 class="ui header">Fragments</h3>
						<p> A fragment is a javascript object nested inside a Document. Fragments can only be referenced from within the
							Document to which they belong, through their ids. These ids can be automatically assigned by the Carbon SDK or
							defined by you and they must always start with an underscore followed by
							a colon, for example:
							<code>_:123</code></p>

						<h3 class="ui header">Named Fragments</h3>
						<p> A Named Fragment is, like a Fragment, a javascript object nested inside a Document.
							However, Named Fragments have ids that are referable from outside of the Document to which they belong.
							These ids must always start with a #, for example:
							<code>#namedFragment</code></p>
						<p>To reference a Named Fragment from  the inside you can use either the id or the complete URI,
							however from outside you can only reference it through the complete URI.
							The complete URI is composed of the Document's URI and the id of the Named Fragment, for example:
							<code>https://carbonldp.com/apps/test-app/myDocument#namedFragment</code>.
						</p>

						<h2 class="ui header">Links</h2>
						<p>Types of relationships</p>
						<p>As we said before all the Carbon Documents must have a parent, this means that when a document is created there is also link formed between the parent Document
							and the new created child. This is a natural link that exists in Carbon, however there are a other types of linkes that can exist.
						</p>
					</section>

						<h2 class="ui header">Types of Documents</h2>
						<section>
							<h3 class="ui header">Root Document</h3>
							<p>When you create an application in Carbon, automatically a root Document is created.
								The root Document contains all the relevant information about your application and is the root parent for all the information and Documents created in it.
								...What is inside a Root Document...

								Carbon Document structure can be viewed as a tree, in the sense that every Document you create is the child of a previous existing Document, beginning with the root
								Document. You can't create a Document that doesn't have a parent Document.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3 class="ui header">Access Control List</h3>
							<p>Access Control List (ACL) is a Carbon Document that exists as a child of every Document created in the platform.
							The ACL is a list of permissions attached to the Document. The ACL can defined which permission will be inheritable
							to any child Document</p>

							<h4>Access Control Entry</h4>
							<p>The Access Control Entry (ACE) is a fragment inside an ACL document, that holds the relations between a specific
							users, permissions and the Carbon Document</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h3 class="ui header">Access Point</h3>
							<p>An Access Point is a carbon Document that is in charge of creating membership realations between its parent Document
								and any other Document. The Access Point has a membership relation configured, this relation will be added in the Document you wish to relate
								to the Parent Document of the Access Point.</p>
