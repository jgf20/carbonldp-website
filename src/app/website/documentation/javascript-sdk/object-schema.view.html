							<p>TODO: Abstract</p>
							<p>The SDK does its best to try to guess the desire outcome of retrieving documents or saving new ones. It tries to parse known data types into native JavaScript types
								and vice versa. But sometimes there is not enough data for the SDK to correctly guess the expected behavior. To make sure the SDK behaves as expected, a web application
								can give more information about properties and objects to the SDK through a context's object schema. An object schema is</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<section>
						<p>Even though the information stored in the platform can seem to be normal JSON, it is not. If you haven't read about the
							<a [routerLink]="[ '../linked-data-concepts' ]">Essential Concepts of Linked Data</a> don't worry, you won't need them to understand the basics behind object schemas,
							but it wouldn't hurt you to read them either.</p>
						<p>The platform stores each document as a set of statements (or triples). These statements add into each other to create an entity. For example, the following object:</p>
						<!--@formatter:off-->
						<pre><code cpHighlight class="javascript">
							var project = &#123;
								name: "Project 1",
								labels: [
									"critical",
									"hr",
									"example"
								],
								createdOn: new Date( 2016, 9, 25 )
							&#125;;
						</code></pre>
						<!--@formatter:on-->
						<p>Would be saved as statements that can be read:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>project</strong> has the <strong>name</strong>, <strong>Project 1</strong> (which is a <strong>string</strong>)</li>
							<li><strong>project</strong> has the <strong>label</strong>, <strong>critical</strong> (which is a <strong>string</strong>)</li>
							<li><strong>project</strong> has the <strong>label</strong>, <strong>hr</strong> (which is a <strong>string</strong>)</li>
							<li><strong>project</strong> has the <strong>label</strong>, <strong>example</strong> (which is a <strong>string</strong>)</li>
							<li><strong>project</strong> was <strong>createdOn</strong>, <strong>2016/09/25</strong> (which is a <strong>date</strong>)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>There are a couple of things to notice here:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The platform saves the type of each property's value</li>
							<li>It doesn't save information about the value of the property label being an array</li>
							<li>The statements aren't ordered</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Because of this there are several common pitfalls that you can fall into when developing web applications with Carbon:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>If you save a document with a property that has an array with only one value, and later on you retrieve the document, the property will point to the value
								directly. It won't be in an array.
							</li>
							<li>Any application that depends on an array keeping its order will behave randomly.</li>
							<li>If your Carbon application is being used by several web applications, a web application could save statements about a property that other web applications don't
								expect (nor understand).
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>All of these pitfalls can be overcome by using <strong>Object Schemas</strong>.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 class="ui header">What is an Object Schema?</h2>
						<p>An object schema provides information about the properties the SDK can expect. On it, a web application can force the SDK to treat values as arrays, force arrays to be
							ordered, tell the SDK to ignore values of unknown types, etc.</p>
						<p>Object schemas are stored inside of a <a [routerLink]="[ '../javascript-sdk-contexts' ]">context</a>. Each context has it's own object schema, and child contexts inherit
							their object schema from their parent's.
						</p>
						<p>To provide new information to the object schema the <code>context.extendObjectSchema</code> method can be used:</p>
						<!--@formatter:off-->
						<pre><code cpHighlight class="javascript">
							appContext.extendObjectSchema( &#123;
								// New information
							&#125; );
						</code></pre>
						<!--@formatter:on-->
						<p>The object passed to the <code>extendObjectSchema</code> method is a <code>@context</code> object defined in the <a
							href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/#the-context">JSON-LD specification</a>. If you aren't familiar with that specification, don't worry. You don't need to understand the
							specification to be able to use object schemas, but again, the more information you posses, the better.</p>
						<p>Properties inside of the object passed to <code>extendObjectSchema</code> will describe different aspects of the schema your application will use.</p>
						<section>
							<h3 class="ui header">Properties</h3>
							<p>To provide information about the properties your application objects will have, a property with the same name needs to be defined on the object schema:</p>
							<!--@formatter:off-->
							<pre><code cpHighlight class="javascript">
								appContext.extendObjectSchema( &#123;
									"labels": &#123;
										// Metadata of the "labels" property
									&#125;
								&#125; );
							</code></pre>
							<!--@formatter:on-->
							<section>
								<h4 class="ui header">Collections (@container)</h4>
								<p>Properties by default are assumed to be one value only unless proven otherwise. That's why if you save a document with a property that holds an array with one
									value, once you retrieve it you'll receive only the value, not the array.</p>
								<p>To specify that a property is always going to hold an array, you can declare the <code>@container</code> property on the object that describes the property.</p>
								<p>That property will need to have one of the following values depending on what collection type you want to have:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><code>@set</code>: for unordered arrays (meaning retrieving a document with that property several times will yield different results)</li>
									<li><code>@list</code>: for ordered arrays (keep in mind that this type of collection takes more space and is more expensive overall)</li>
									<li><code>@map</code>: for language based maps (TO BE DOCUMENTED)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>For example, imagine that the application handled objects like the following one:</p>
								<!--@formatter:off-->
								<pre><code cpHighlight class="javascript">
									var project = &#123;
										labels: [
											"important"
										],
										tasks: [
											&#123;
												title: "Do something"
											&#125;,
											&#123;
												title: "Then do something else"
											&#125;,
										]
									&#125;;
								</code></pre>
								<!--@formatter:on-->
								<p>The <code>labels</code> property is going to have a collection as a value, but it doesn't need to keep it's order. After all, its only valuable information is
									that it "has" this and that label.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, the <code>tasks</code> property needs to keep the order of tasks because it indicates the order of their execution or importance.</p>
								<p>The object schema should be extended as follows:</p>
								<!--@formatter:off-->
								<pre><code cpHighlight class="javascript">
									appContext.extendObjectSchema( &#123;
										"labels": &#123;
											"@container": "@set"
										&#125;,
										"tasks": &#123;
											"@container": "@list"
										&#125;
									&#125; );
								</code></pre>
								<!--@formatter:on-->
								<p>Having done that, persisting the resource and then reading it again will yield the expected results.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4 class="ui header">Data types (@type)</h4>
								<p>The SDK does a really good job on saving values with the right data type. Strings will be saved as strings, booleans will be saved as booleans, etc. But imagine
									the following scenario:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Application A and B are developed using the same Carbon application to store their data</li>
									<li>Both applications are programmed to understand Project objects with a property "content" that holds a string</li>
									<li>Later on complex "content" properties are added to application B. Now app B understands "content" properties that hold objects (with a type, and other
										properties).
									</li>
								</ol>
								<p>Because application A hasn't been updated, and both apps are using the same data, app A is probably going to crash whenever it finds a complex "content" property
									.</p>
								<p>To avoid this, it is a good practice to define what type the property is meant to have on each application. This is done by specifying a <code>@type</code>
									property on the object that describes the property "content":
								</p>
								<!--@formatter:off-->
								<pre><code cpHighlight class="javascript">
									appContext.extendObjectSchema( &#123;
										"content": &#123;
											"@type": "string"
										&#125;
									&#125; );
								</code></pre>
								<!--@formatter:on-->
								<p>If the application A has its object schema set this way it won't have a problem. The SDK will filter any "content" non string value when retrieving the project.</p>
								<p>The most common accepted types are:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><code>@id</code>: When the value type is a pointer to another object</li>
									<li><code>string</code></li>
									<li><code>boolean</code></li>
									<li><code>integer</code></li>
									<li><code>double</code></li>
									<li><code>float</code></li>
									<li><code>long</code></li>
									<li><code>date</code></li>
									<li><code>dateTime</code></li>
									<li><code>time</code></li>
								</ul>
