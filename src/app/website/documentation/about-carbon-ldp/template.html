				<p>Carbon provides services for working with data through a JavaScript SDK and REST API. Data is stored in a graph
					database, which is more advantageous than traditional relational databases in a wide variety of cases. Since the
					data is stored natively in RDF (the Resource Description Framework), Carbon makes it easy to model any kind of
					resources without the need for rigid schemas. Need a new class, instance, property, or relationship? Simply add
					it on-the-fly. Forget about primary and foreign key relationships. In Carbon, everything is semantic - capable of
					linking data within your organization and on the World Wide Web.</p>

				<p>Carbon LDP turns data graphs into documents so that working with data is like working with web pages - simple. Each
					document also acts as a container for managing members and as an access point that can be queried with SPARQL.
					Carbon makes managing data more like managing content - easy.</p>

				<p>Carbon LDP is currently in late ALPHA-stage testing with a BETA release planned to be available in July, 2016.</p>
