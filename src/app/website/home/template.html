					<h2>Innovation for the Next Web</h2>

					<p>In his 2009 TED talk, Tim Berners-Lee (a.k.a. The Father of the Web) urged us onward toward the
						complete vision for the World Wide Web. "It's called Linked Data," he said. "I want you to make
						it. I want you to demand it." We're working to achieve that vision by creating an innovation
						platform that can transform your enterprise and give you new advantages from advanced
						technology.</p>

					<h2>Standards Based</h2>

					<p>Carbon LDP is based on Semantic Web standards developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
						with contributions from industry leaders such as IBM, Microsoft, and Oracle. Base22 is a member
						of the W3C and participated in the development of the specification for the Linked Data
						Platform (LDP). Carbon LDP is a fully compliant LDP server that will integrate and interoperate
						with industry tools from leading vendors.</p>

					<h2>What Developers Really Want</h2>

					<p>As enterprise-class web engineers, our work takes us behind the scenes at world-leading
						organizations. We know how industry titans use information technology and where many of their
						pain-points exist. But we're not just filling gaps - we're creating an entirely new paradigm
						that can transform the way you work. They say that "necessity is the mother of invention."
						Carbon is the platform we've always wanted, so we're building it. We think you're going to
						love it too.</p>
